======================

A FPL library that gets all the basic stats for each player, gw-specific data for each player and season history of each player

## FAQ

### Player Position Data

In players_raw.csv, element_type is the field that corresponds to the position.
1 = GK
2 = DEF
3 = MID
4 = FWD

## Downloading Your Team Data

You can download the data for your team by executing the following steps:

```
python teams_scraper.py <team_id>
#Eg: python teams_scraper.py 4582
```

This will create a new folder called "team_<team_id>_data18-19" with individual files of all the important data
